This corner of the web is a place to sit back, relax and enjoy all things
related to Science, Computing and Mathematics. The InterWebs can be an
overwhelming place with daily occurances of hype-trains, counter-hype arguments,
crises and uproars.

If all of that stresses you out, professionally or personally, make yourself
some hot chocolate and go through some of [my articles](/posts). Take things
slow, one byte at a time.

If you are in a fix, feel free to reach out to ranvir@numbersandreality.com for
an obligation free consultation. Below are some of the services I offer:
